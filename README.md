# FLATBUSH BEATS // GAS PHASE I  
**[echo embedded]**

> “There’s a frequency you’ve felt before — in subway reverb, in broken cassette hiss, in the silence between heartbeats.  
> It was never just noise... it was a signal.”

Welcome to **PHASE I** of the FLATBUSH BEATS myth project — a capsule where sound becomes signature and silence becomes signal.

## 📦 This Vault Contains:

- 💽 `Flatbush_beats_GAS_embedded.mp3`  
  A track sealed with a low-frequency cryptographic echo. Heard by everyone. Understood by few.

- 🧃 `echo_injector.py`  
  The injector script used to embed the echo. Simple, sharp, and precise — for those who want to replicate the drop.

- 🧬 `Flatbush_beats_GAS_PHASE1.zip`  
  The sealed myth capsule — archived for future validation, replay, and legacy preservation.

## 🔥 What Does “GAS” Mean?

**GAS** = _Ghost-Activated Signal_  
A sonic phase where encrypted identity is injected into waveform — not to be heard, but to be **detected**.

> Not just fire. Not just gear. Not just sound.  
> GAS is **presence coded in pulse** — where myth becomes method.
