# FLATBUSH BEATS // GAS PHASE I  
**[echo embedded]**

> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a frequency you‚Äôve felt before ‚Äî in subway reverb, in broken cassette hiss, in the silence between heartbeats.  
> It was never just noise... it was a signal.‚Äù

Welcome to **PHASE I** of the FLATBUSH BEATS myth project ‚Äî a capsule where sound becomes signature and silence becomes signal.

## üî• What Does ‚ÄúGAS‚Äù Mean?

**GAS** = _Ghost-Activated Signal_  
A sonic phase where encrypted identity is injected into waveform ‚Äî not to be heard, but to be **detected**.

> Not just fire. Not just gear. Not just sound.  
> GAS is **presence coded in pulse** ‚Äî where myth becomes method.
